# Movie Recommender System - README

## Overview
This repository contains code for a Movie Recommender System implemented in Python using natural language processing techniques. The system uses the content of movie descriptions and other relevant information to recommend similar movies to the user. The core idea is to find similarities between movies based on their tags, which are generated by combining information such as movie overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

## Prerequisites
To run the Movie Recommender System, you need the following libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and was accessed through the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) website. It consists of two CSV files:
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains information about movies such as budget, genres, homepage, id, keywords, original language, original title, overview, popularity, production companies, production countries, release date, revenue, runtime, spoken languages, status, tagline, title, vote average, and vote count.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains information about movie credits, including movie_id, title, cast, and crew.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Loading
The first step is to load the provided dataset `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` using the Pandas library. The data contains information about movies and their credits.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
In this step, we preprocess the data to extract relevant features and remove unnecessary columns that will not be used in the recommendation system. We also handle missing values, as some movie descriptions might be empty.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
To generate tags for each movie, we merge the movie overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew information into a single column named 'tags.' Tags play a crucial role in calculating similarities between movies and recommending similar ones to users.

### Step 4: Text Preprocessing
Before converting the tags to vectors, we perform text preprocessing. This includes converting the text to lowercase, tokenizing the words, and applying stemming to reduce words to their root form. The NLTK library is used for text preprocessing tasks.

### Step 5: Text Vectorization
To convert the tags into numerical form for similarity calculations, we use the Bag of Words technique with CountVectorizer from Scikit-learn. The CountVectorizer converts text data into a matrix of word counts, where each row represents a movie, and each column represents a word. We limit the number of features (words) to 5000 using the `max_features` parameter.

### Step 6: Calculating Cosine Similarity
Using the text vectorized data, we calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of movies. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space, and it provides a similarity score between 0 and 1. A score of 1 means the vectors are identical, and a score of 0 means they are orthogonal.

### Step 7: Movie Recommendations
Finally, we create a function named `recommend()` that takes a movie title as input and returns five similar movie recommendations based on their tags and cosine similarity scores. The function finds the index of the input movie in the dataset, retrieves the cosine similarity scores for all movies, sorts them in descending order, and returns the titles of the five most similar movies.

## How it works
The Movie Recommender System calculates the cosine similarity between movies based on their tags, which are generated from relevant movie information. By using text vectorization and cosine similarity, the system can find movies that are most similar to the user's input movie, thus providing personalized recommendations.

## Summary
The Movie Recommender System is a content-based recommendation system that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their interests. By utilizing natural language processing techniques and cosine similarity, the system identifies movies with similar content and suggests them to the user
